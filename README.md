# Dungeons and Dragons Initiative Tracker

This project takes advantage of `socket.io` to allow a Dungeon Master
and their group of players to move through a battle by tracking,
sorting, and notifying players as their turn in the initiative order
comes up.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js (Express MVC framework)
* Socket.io (Real-Time user-user connection)
* React (Quick and responsive front-end)
* Webpack 3 (Build Tool/Javascript Compiler)

## Currently Available Features

* Players can log in as their own characters
* A DM can log in and have admin-level control over the flow of battle
* Player character data has been preloaded
* Players can submit their initiatives to the DM
* The DM can add and remove monsters from the battle
* Players can only pass their turn if it is currently their turn
